# Syllabus: Math 449, Fall 2021

## Course Title

Numerical Applied Mathematics

## Summary

This course is intended to serve as a first introduction of numerical methods.
The course will cover basic numerical methods for solving various problems that
arise in mathematics, science and engineering: linear and nonlinear equations,
eigenvalue problems, ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We will introduce
methods that perform numerical differentiation and integration, polynomial
interpolation and analyze them.

Prerequisites are first courses in calculus, linear algebra and ordinary
differential equations. Basic programming proficiency will be helpful but is not
required.

grade will be dropped.

There will be a midterm and a final exam. The midterm exam will be 30% and the
final exam 40% of the final grade.

## Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to collaborate on problems together, however the
submitted write-up should be entirely their own. Students are expected to adhere
to the [university academic integrity
policy](https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/undergraduate-student-academic-integrity-policy/).
 
## COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols

While on campus, it is imperative that students follow all public health
guidelines established to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our
community. Review the [University protocols](
